# 1. Document Purpose

This document is the operational baseline for the two Frevity MVP sprints already defined in Trello.

It exists to recover the project plan if implementation is interrupted, context is lost, or a technical decision needs to be checked against the original delivery objective.

The architecture itself is documented separately.

This document answers:

- What must be delivered?
- In which sprint?
- In what order?
- What does each Trello card mean?
- What are the dependencies?
- What are the acceptance criteria?
- What is the critical delivery path?
- What should happen if the schedule slips?

---

# 2. Sprint Structure

The project has **exactly two sprints**.

```text
SPRINT 01 — SÁBADO 29/08
Foundation + Product Core
        │
        ▼
SPRINT 02 — DOMINGO 30/08
UX + Globalization + SEO + QA + Production
```

No additional sprint is part of the current MVP plan.

---

# 3. Product Scope

## 3.1 MVP objective

Frevity is a global web calculator intended to help users estimate the real landed cost of freight/logistics operations.

The MVP consists of two primary pages:

```text
/
Landing Page

/calculator
Application Page
```

The initial platform supports:

- English;
- Spanish;
- Japanese;
- Portuguese.

Initial monetization:

```text
Free product
    ↓
Useful traffic
    ↓
Non-excessive advertising
```

Future subscriptions are deliberately outside the MVP.

---

# 4. SPRINT 01 — SÁBADO 29/08

## Sprint Objective

Establish the technical foundation and deliver the complete functional calculator core.

The end-of-day objective is:

> A user must be able to open the application, enter the relevant freight/cost information, execute the calculation and understand the result.

+ Insurance
+ Customs
+ Handling
+ Local Transport
+ Other Costs
= Landed Cost
```

Additional derived metrics may include:

```text
Cost per Kg
Cost per Unit
Logistics Percentage
```

```text
React
Next.js UI
Tailwind
Analytics
Ads
Browser APIs
```

### Acceptance Criteria

# 8. Critical Path

The highest-risk delivery path is:

```text
Project Initialization
        ↓
Application Architecture
        ↓
Calculation Domain Model
        ↓
Landed Cost Engine
        ↓

        ↓
Domain Configuration
        ↓
Production Smoke Test
        ↓
Final Product Review
        ↓
Production Release
```

This path must be protected from scope creep.

---

# 9. Parallelization Strategy

Some cards can progress independently once their dependencies are satisfied.

```text
                 ┌── Design System
                 │
Architecture ────┼── i18n Core
                 │
                 └── Domain Model
```

Later:

```text
Domain Model ──→ Landed Cost Engine ──→ Reality Score
                                      │
                                      └── Unit Tests
```

While:

```text
Architecture ──→ Landing Structure ──→ Landing Responsive UI
```

On Sunday:

```text
i18n ──→ Internationalization Completion ──→ Language Selector

SEO Foundation ──→ Structured Data

UX ──→ Accessibility ──→ Cross-Browser QA

Performance ──→ Ads Integration
```

This allows the weekend to be used efficiently without breaking architectural dependencies.

---

# 10. Risk Management

## Risk 01 — Scope Expansion

### Risk

New ideas appear during implementation and consume time.

### Impact

The core calculator or deployment may be delayed.

### Mitigation

Do not introduce during this MVP:

```text
Authentication
Database
Subscriptions
Payments
User accounts
Saved calculations
Public API
Admin dashboard
Mobile application
Microservices
Redis
PostgreSQL
Complex external integrations
```

Unless a requirement becomes critical to the MVP.

---

## Risk 02 — Calculation Complexity

### Risk

Business rules become more complicated than expected.

### Impact

Calculation errors can invalidate the product.

### Mitigation

Protect:

```text
Domain Model
    ↓
Calculation Engine
    ↓
Automated Tests
```

Do not solve business-rule complexity by moving logic into React components.

---

## Risk 03 — UI Consumes the Schedule

### Risk

Visual refinement takes longer than expected.

### Impact

Functional delivery and production release are threatened.

### Mitigation

Priority:

```text
Functional correctness
        >
Validation
        >
Production stability
        >
Performance
        >

## Risk 04 — Third-Party Scripts

### Risk

Ads and analytics negatively affect performance.

### Impact

Poor user experience, layout instability and slower loading.

### Mitigation

- Load non-critical scripts appropriately.
- Isolate third-party integrations.
- Never make the calculator depend on them.
- Remove or simplify anything that becomes a blocker.

---

## Risk 05 — Deployment / DNS Delay

### Risk

Domain or hosting configuration takes longer than expected.

### Impact

The product can be finished locally but not released.

### Mitigation

Do not leave deployment until the final minutes.

The production path should be validated as soon as the application is stable enough.

# 11. Delivery Delay Protocol

The two-day plan is intentionally aggressive.

If the project cannot finish every card by Sunday, the response must **not** be to leave the unfinished work undefined.

Instead:

```text
Identify unfinished cards
        ↓
Classify them
        ↓
Protect production-critical work
        ↓
Finish the MVP-critical items first
        ↓
Complete remaining cards immediately after the planned window
```

## Priority in case of delay

### Level P0 — Must finish

```text
Calculator functionality
Calculation engine
Validation
Results
Four-language critical flow
Production build
Production environment
Domain
Production smoke test
Security review
Production release
```

### Level P1 — Finish immediately after P0

```text
UX Refinement
Accessibility
Cross-Browser QA
SEO
Structured Data
Performance refinements
```

### Level P2 — Can be temporarily simplified

```text
Advanced analytics
Advanced ad optimization
Non-essential visual polish
```

# 12. Why Unfinished Work Must Be Completed Quickly

A delayed card is not automatically a failed project.

The dangerous situation is allowing a delayed card to become **open-ended technical debt**.

For Frevity, the cost of postponing unfinished MVP work increases quickly because the application is being released as a public global product.

An unfinished:

- validation layer can create incorrect user results;
- performance task can increase acquisition cost and reduce conversion;
- SEO task can delay organic discovery;
- accessibility task can exclude users;
- security task can expose the product to avoidable risk;
- deployment task prevents the product from generating real-world usage data;
- calculation task compromises the core value proposition.

Therefore:

> **Anything not completed by the end of Sunday must be explicitly recorded and completed as soon as possible, with P0 production and business-critical items taking precedence.**

The objective is not to extend the project indefinitely.

The objective is to **close the gap between planned delivery and actual production readiness as quickly as possible**.

# 13. Final Delivery Principle

The weekend is successful only when Frevity moves from:

```text
Code
```

to:

```text
Functional Product
```

and finally:

```text
Public Product
```

The final chain is:

```text
Development
    ↓
Validated Application
    ↓
Production Build
    ↓
Production Environment
    ↓
frevity.com
    ↓
Real Users
    ↓
Real Usage Data
    ↓
Future Product Decisions
```

The MVP does not need to contain every future feature.

It needs to prove that the central proposition works:

> **A user can use Frevity to estimate the real landed cost of a freight operation quickly and understand the result.**
